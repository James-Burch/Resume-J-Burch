                    Over the past 13 months, I've built a variety of projects using different technologies.
                    Each project represents a milestone in my learning journey, from static websites to
                    full-stack applications and even machine learning models.

                        These projects showcase my progression from basic HTML/CSS to complex frameworks and
                        machine learning. Each project presented unique challenges that helped me grow as a developer.
